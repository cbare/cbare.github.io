## The silence of the music apps

Why do my music apps keep dying? Lala, [thanks Apple][9]. [Rdio][1] - [There Wasn't No Party Like the Rdio Party, Then the Rdio Party Stopped][2]. Now, [Google Play Music][10]. The [streaming music market][8] can only support so many players, apparently.

## Sunsetting Google Play Music

Consolidating redundant offerings makes sense. It's too bad Google couldn't bring YouTube music up to parity with Google Music first. YouTube's web-based player has weak support for queue management, [lacking several features][11] long available in Google Play Music's player. [Users are unhappy with the downgrade][12].
