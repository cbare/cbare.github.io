This [video out of Jay Shendure's lab][1] is a great piece of scientific communication. Its about a technique called saturation genome editing, with which you can characterize of some significant fraction of all possible genetic variants of BRCA. It's a fore-taste of how CRISPR can be used to shine a light on previously difficult topics and provides an in-vitro assay to establish ground truth relative to annotation-based [CADD score][3].
