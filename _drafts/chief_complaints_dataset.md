# An open chief complaint dataset

Due to privacy concerns, open data for machine learning (ML) in medical applications is hard to come by. But unrestricted data is useful in developing models, pretraining, and benchmarking. An open dataset of synthetic chief complaints could serve as the basis for applying the recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) to healthcare. NLP models can then serve as clinician extenders, saving time for both patient and clinician and decreasing costs to overstretched health systems.

A chief complaint is the patient's description in lay terms of why they are seeking medical attention. An open dataset of chief complaints might be generated by  crowd-sourced workers or volunteers. Receiving a prompt consisting of a medical condition, workers would be asked to describe this condition in their own words as if they were speaking to a clinician. Example responses to a prompt of "nausea" might be: "I feel nauseous", "My tummy hurts", or "I have an upset stomach and abdominal cramping that started last night after I ate cheap sushi."

Volunteers would be instructed to avoid any identifying or overtly autobiographical information. Because they are fictional, these chief complaints could be free of constraints that accompany real medical data. Synthetic chief complaints will differ from real ones, but should be similar enough to generate workable models. Collecting and annotating the data could be done either by developing a custom app or using one of the established crowd-sourcing platforms.

Learning to associate patient generated chief complaints with standard medical terms, with the prompt as a label, is a useful initial task. Other target variables for predictive modeling include diagnosis and relevant medications. For these tasks, additional labeling could be done either by the volunteers themselves or by labelers with medical training. These could then serve as intermediate end-points for training chat-bots. Given a dialog between patient and chat-bot, interesting tasks further downstream would be extraction of information such as symptoms confirmed or denied, onset/duration of symptoms, and summarization for presentation to clinicians.

[Healthcare chatbots][2] are not a unique idea. NLP is being applied to primary care at [98point6][1] (my former employer), [Bablyon Health][3], [Ada Health][4], [Bouy][5], and [elsewhere][6]. But openness has the power to bring about progress. Developing ML models for healthcare in the open will bring many eyes to bear on the problem and help ensure that they result in increasing access to low-cost high-quality care.
