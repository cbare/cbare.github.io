1. Analytics - helps a business understand its customers better, get better return on marketing, improve existing products. Do what you're already doing better. Probably invisible to the customer. Walmart succeeds through being smart about supply chain logistics. Otherwise, it's no different than Sears or J.C. Penny.

2. Customer-facing data products - helps customers improve what they do or use your product better. Recommender systems, like those provided by Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify are great examples.

3. Data pool becomes the product, enables entirely new products. Like Google - they make a search engine, maps, and office apps but these are free. The real product is Google ads. GitHub is a source code repository, but using that data they now have Copilot.
