Being data-driven and AI-enabled is trendy, but easier said than done. Most orgs will need to evolve from some baseline towards greater levels of data and modeling capability.

## Stages

Roughly, the states of maturity are these:

1. First, use your own data. Internal data products help a business understand its customers better, get better return on marketing, improve existing products, do what you're already doing better. Probably invisible to the customer. Walmart succeeds through being smart about supply chain logistics. Otherwise, it's no different than Sears or J.C. Penny.

2. Customer-facing data products improve the experience of using existing products. Recommender systems, like those provided by Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify are great examples.

3. As a data pool grows and matures, it becomes a product in it's own right or enables entirely new products. Google's search engine, maps, and office apps are free. The real product is Google ads. GitHub is a source code repository, but using that data they now have Copilot.

Access to data.

Oranizational commitment to capturing high quality data and a recognition of the value in doing so. cares about data.

Maturity of software development practice.

Models have some error rate. Engineer for both paths - the happy path where the model works and the path where the model fails and a human has to pick up the pieces. How well you handle the failure modes determines whether your model will be loved or hated. Ideally, the failure path is no worse than what happened before the model existed.


Customer buy-in. Ethical use data in the interest of those providing the data. The interface between legal and technical. 
The legal terms of a contract must be understandable and implementable in a data environment. Pragmatically, a small set of flags indicating allowed and not-allowed use of a particular customer's data. The terms of a contract may be time-bound and then change. Care needs to be taken to avoid bespoke contractual terms that will be forgotten and then likely violated. If you allow customers to opt-out at any time, think through what happens when they take you up on it.

## Feedback

usage metrics, downstream metrics (time saved, purchase, etc.), feedback on model performance, what should have been predicted.
