[Christopher Manning][3]'s class [Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning][1] has a well deserved reputation for being challenging, super interesting, and very topic these days. It's available in a professional development version [XCS224N][2] through Stanford online. The [lectures are on YouTube][11].

## Review and parting thoughts

The Christopher Manning lectures are all excellent. I particularly enjoyed the his lectures on word embeddings, John Hewitt's lectures on Self-Attention and Transformers and Jesse Mu's lecute on Prompting and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.

The course felt a bit jumbled. It's pieced together from lectures from 2021 through 2023. I'm not sure they helped continuity by chopping those lectures up into 10-30 minute segments. In such a fast moving field, some of the topics feel dated in 2024, but none are without interesting aspects.

The paid version includes graded assignment and course-facilitators to help guide you along. It's not cheap and, as far as I can tell, the majority of the materials are openly available, so use your own judgement on whether its worth it for you.
