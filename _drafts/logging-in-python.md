Python's logging module has confused me for years. Why doesn't this work?

```
logger = logging.getLogger('foo')
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
logger.info('nope')
```



Let's say I'm debugging the tricky module foo.quux. So, I want to see debug level logs for that module, but only warnings or higher for the rest of the vast and chatty code base.

## TL;DR

Log messages propagate up through tree of loggers toward the root.
