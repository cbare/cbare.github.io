### Origins

Māori legend says that Māui hauled a tremendous fish up from the sea using a magic hook. The fish became the North Island, 'Te Ika a Māui'. The South Island was the canoe from which Māui and his brothers were fishing, 'Te Waka a Māui' (Māui’s canoe). The Kaikōura Peninsula is where Māui stood and Stewart Island is the anchor of the canoe.

According to the traditional story, Kupe discovered New Zealand, sailing large double-hulled canoe named Mātāwhaorua from the mythical homeland of Hawaiki. Kupe's wife, Kuramārōtini, spotted a cloud, signifying the presence of land from which we get the name Aotearoa, “the land of the long white cloud”. Later, a fleet of seven canoes carried the ancestors of the various Iwi, or Māori tribes, to New Zealand.

Modern historians conclude, based on genetic and linguistic evidence, that Polynesian settlers from the Cook, Society, and Austral islands arrived in New Zealand during the 1200s towards the end of the Polynesian expansion across the Pacific.

### Discovery

Cornelis de Houtman led the first Dutch expedition to the spice islands during 1595 through 1597. Plagued by scurvy, piracy, infighting and clashes with indigenous Javanese, only 3 out of 4 ships and 87 of 249 crew returned. The voyage none the less turned a profit. By the 1640's, the VOC, the Dutch East India Company, had established the colonial capital of Batavia and extended their trade routes onward to Japan.

In 1642, at the peak of the Dutch Golden Age, while Rembrandt worked on the painting we know as The Night Watch, Abel Janzoon Tasman sailed from Batavia with orders to search for a mythical continent believed to be in the southern Pacific. This is what he believed he had discovered when he spotted the mountainous coast of the South Island of New Zealand. After an ill-fated encounter with the Māori of Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri, Tasman returned empty-handed to the disapointment of his VOC masters.

It would be over a century before the next European, Captain James Cook, would again visit New Zealand on the 6th of October 1769.


### Colonial Government

"Up to one-fifth of the Māori population was killed during the intertribal Musket Wars of the 1810s, 1820s and 1830s."

Treaty of Waitangi
6 February 1840
"Regarded as New Zealand’s founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi has been a source of debate and controversy ever since 1840. The differences between the English- and Māori-language versions of the Treaty are at the heart of this debate."


Robert FitzRoy was breifly governer of New Zealand from 26 December 1843 to 17 November 1845, having previously visited New Zealand as captain of HMS Beagle during Charles Darwin's famous voyage. On 21 December 1835 the Beagle anchored in the Bay of Islands for a 9 day visit, the harbour "flanked by the grogshops and brothels of Kororāreka on one side and the Church Missionary Society (CMS) settlement at Paihia on the other." Darwin seems not to have been favorably impressed.


### Parliamentary government

A parliamentary government was established in 1854, the vote granted to men owning or renting property in 1953, and to Māori men in 1867, for four separate Māori seats. In 1879, the property requirement was lifted and in 1893 New Zealand became the first country to grant women the vote.

Like Americans, New Zealanders nurtured a feeling of being part of a noble experiment, a new society that could improve upon the rigid old-world class system. But, unlike Americans, they retained strong loyalty to the Motherland. The eager volunteering at the start of WWI and the subsequent veneration of the sacrifices of the ANZAC forces during the Gallipoli Campaign reflect a desire among New Zealanders to prove themselves worthy citizens of Empire.

New Zealanders seem to have viewed the 1931 Statute of Westminster, which gave autonomy to the dominions of Australia, Canada, Irish Free State, Newfoundland, New Zealand and South Africa, as something of a demotion in status. Over 95% of the Pākehā population were of British origins, and felt ‘more British than the British’.

David Lange became PM during the financial crisis of the early 1980's. He and Finance Minister Roger Douglas implemented free market reforms and deregulation. Lange is also known for his anti-nuclear stance declaring New Zealand a nuclear-free zone in 1987.
