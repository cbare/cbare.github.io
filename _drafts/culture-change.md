In my past two roles, I've been an IC charged with helping drive culture change. In both cases, I was hiered by a first tier team lead whose goals weren't supported by the endemic culture. In different ways, the company wanted to do a thing. The practices and expectations didn't support doing the thing. I was coming in from orgs that had the desired practices in place and the team leads hoped that I could help bring what was lacking to their teams. In both cases, the changes were rejected.

Could a better person than myself have stepped in and made it work? Probably. But, that person is hard to find, expensive to hire, and wants your job - the team lead - or your boss's job.

## What did I try and why didn't it work?

The main tool I used was example - just following the habits in a visible way and looking for signs of uptake. In my experience, giving presentations and writing "best practice" documents doesn't so much change minds as let you know who your allies are. That can be followed up with one-on-one discussion with those of like mind. Are there other tools available to an IC?

Maybe trying to drive culture change from an IC role is just not a viable proposition. As an IC, you don't have the right tools. You can't set the criterea for performance evaluation. You don't influence raises, promotions, or who gets let go. You can't speak other ICs as a leader nor to other leaders as a peer. Saying "No!" is the easiest way for someone to assert that they're higher in the hierarchy than you. In general, the easiest reaction to change is "no". Often, the no's have it.

People don't like change. Human psychology is such that people don't like being told they're doing it wrong. Especially if they know they're doing it wrong. The change itself may be something they want. But they'll be damned if they're going to let some new guy show up, make it happen, and take credit for it. Heals dig in. Always, there are reasons why things got the way they are and those reasons, political or technical, don't just dissappear.

## Show don't tell

pilot project launched with fanfare
public praise for the results from bigwigs

skunkworks
vulnerable, needs a high-level protector


Even with support from the top, culture change is hard. You hear a lot of talk and then nothing much happens. Maybe, it's just a slow process. Maybe the right expectation is for it to happen so slowly that it's hard to percieve, thus avoiding trigging the organizational immune system.
