Artificial intelligence-supported screen reading versus
standard double reading in the Mammography Screening
with Artificial Intelligence trial (MASAI)
Lång et al, Lancet Oncology 2023

AI + radiologist reduces screening workload by 44.3% relative to double reading, the standard in many European countries. AI + radiologist detected 20% more cancers at a comparible false positive rate. Comparing rates of interval cancers will be done after 2 years.

"In retrospective studies, about 20–30% of interval cancers have been shown to display highly suspicious signs of malignancy at the preceding screening mammogram,6–8"

"Among all preclinical cancer cases, 4.5% (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 0.1% to 14.8%) were estimated to be nonprogressive. In a program of biennial screening from age 50 to 74 years, 15.4% (UI, 9.4% to 26.5%) of screen-detected cancer cases were estimated to be overdiagnosed, with 6.1% (UI, 0.2% to 20.1%) due to detecting indolent preclinical cancer and 9.3% (UI, 5.5% to 13.5%) due to detecting progressive preclinical cancer in women who would have died of an unrelated cause before clinical diagnosis."
