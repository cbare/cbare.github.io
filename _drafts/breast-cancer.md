A few years back, I worked in a genomics lab in Seattle that was located directly opposite an Amazon building. The well funded Amazon folks hung a big handwritten "We're hiring!" sign in the window. The researchers responded with a sign of their own saying, "We're curing cancer!" Maybe true in the long-run.

## Screening mammograms

The American College of Radiology recommends annual screening mammograms for all women over 40[1][1]. The American Cancer Society recommends women age 45 to 54 get mammograms every year and every 2 years thereafter. Early-stage breast cancer has a five-year relative survival rate of 99 percent. For late-stage metastatic cancer, that number drops to 29 percent.[2][2]

There's some controversy around breast cancer screening. Screening programs are expensive and have a non-zero error rate in either direction. Findings can be ambiguous. Patients are exposed to radiation or contrast agents. But, there's little disagreement that catching cancer early makes a difference.
