The notion that I found particular appealing was that the organizing priciples of living systems and artificial systems were similar if not the same at some deep level.

Organized hierarchically,
cells into tissue into organs into systems into organisms into the interdependent web of ecology

Information flow in the cell:
DNA -> RNA -> protein

## Parts of a cell

Nucleus
DNA repair

Ribosomes

Pathways, protein localization (cell surface, organelles)


## Metabolism

Map of metabolism, Biochemical Pathways
metabolon

## Data types

- genes
  - location on genome, promoters, regulatory elements
  - epigenetics, 3D structure
- expression - how much RNA
- proteomics
  - mass spectrometry
  - olink
  - somalogic

- networks
  - regulation
  - protein-protein interaction
