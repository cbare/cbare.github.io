Cycles abound in the universe. In Nature, economies, and history, things come in waves,  rising, cresting, falling back, and rising again.

We're living through a time when our civilization is reaching for incredible heights, rising increasingly steeply. Is a falling back inevitable? Over again in history, civilizations will advance toward a new era, only to come apart at the seams just before crossing the threshold. Centuries later, students of history marvel that they were so close.

Examples - Roman technology, Chinese cycles of dynasties?
