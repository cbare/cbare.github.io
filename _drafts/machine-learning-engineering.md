A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning. Pedro Domingos



If you engineer your product to scale right from the start, you'll probably never get to the point where it matters.



The discipline of software engineering is young compared to, say, building bridges. But the software engineering is relatively mature compared to engineering learning systems.

The toolbox of software engineering tools - modularity, testing, code review, etc. - was developed for systems that transform inputs to outputs through algorithms hand coded by humans. That toolbox still applies when the algorithm is learned from data, but some different concerns come into play.

Verifying properties of the training data.
Testing in the presence of non-determinism.
Assessing performance at training time.
Monitoring performance in production.

You need to be this tall:
Note that the Airbnb team already had experience with machine learning, data pipelines in place, and an online controlled experiment platform available. From this foundation, they took their first steps towards neural networks.

Lars Albertsson based on experience in data-lakes scenarios using Spark, Luigi, and AirFlow with the goal of enabling new work patterns for innovative uses of data

+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Weak workflow orchestration         | use Luigi or AirFlow                                                   |
| New Technology / old patterns       | work patterns >> technology                                            |
| Deviate from functional principles  | Immutability, idempotency, reproducibility                             |
| Weak online / offline separation    | careful handover                                                       |
| Premature scaling                   | go to distributed only when cost is justified                          |
| Reading all the data                | incremental                                                            |
| Premature streaming                 | go to streaming only when cost is justified                            |
| Crunching in the dark               | instrument pipelines, measure unexpected values, consistency           |
| Weak agility                        | end-to-end testing, reduce needless heterogeneity in tools and formats |
| Late governance                     | consider security, compliance, testing, schema evolution               |
