Machine learning is a little bit different.

The discipline of engineering algorithmic systems is young, compared to, say, building bridges. But the software engineering is relatively mature compared to engineering learning systems.

The toolbox of software engineering tools - abstraction, modularity, testing, code review, etc. - was developed for systems that transform inputs to outputs through algorithms hand coded by humans. That toolbox still applies when the algorithm is learned from data, but some different concerns come into play.

Verifying properties of the training data.
Testing in the presence of non-determinism.
Assessing performance at training time.
Monitoring performance in production.
