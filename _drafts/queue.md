## Automation of primary care medicine

### Text-based works great for a subset of issues.
- refill routine recurring prescriptions, with appropriate checks
    - asthma
    - mild depression / anxiety
- embarrasing minor complaints, STD, UTI, yeast infections, erectile dysfunction
- reassurance / advice
    - I have a cold or flu, what should I do?
- symptom checkers, gradings and scores
    - GAD-7 measures anxiety
    - PHQ-9 measures depression
    - ACQ or ACT measures asthma
- triage, route requests to the appropriate provider
    - primary care doc
    - nurse
    - PA
    - behavioral health counselor
    - pharmacist

### Automated follow-up
- physician prescribes a 3 day course of antibiotics for a UTI
 - on day 4, an app asks, for each symptom has it
    - resolved
    - improved, but not completely resolved
    - not improved
 - a decision-tree and/or physician can review cases that have not reached the expected outcome.
- physician prescribes a med
 - systems know if/when patient fill prescription
    - if not filled, ask “Why haven't you filled your prescription?”
    - if filled, after an appropriate time and periodically, ask
        - Are you taking your meds?
        - Are you experiencing side-effects?
        - Any change/improvement in symptoms, if expected?
