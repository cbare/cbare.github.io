There are specific places and time when the right mix of creative people came together and something special happened. They begin riffing off of each other like jazz musicians, learning from each other and building on each other’s work. When everything lines up just right, the results are an intellectual and artistic efflorescence, humans at their most creative.

[Brian Eno][1] coined a term for this: “Scenius stands for the intelligence and the intuition of a whole cultural scene. It is the communal form of the concept of the genius.”

[Kevin Kelly writes][3], the geography of scenius is nurtured by several factors:

- Mutual appreciation — Risky moves are applauded by the group, subtlety is appreciated, and friendly competition goads the shy. Scenius can be thought of as the best of peer pressure.
- Rapid exchange of tools and techniques — As soon as something is invented, it is flaunted and then shared. Ideas flow quickly because they are flowing inside a common language and sensibility.
- Network effects of success — When a record is broken, a hit happens, or breakthrough erupts, the success is claimed by the entire scene. This empowers the scene to further success.
- Local tolerance for the novelties — The local “outside” does not push back too hard against the transgressions of the scene. The renegades and mavericks are protected by this buffer zone.

When I was fist working in the bay area, I found that there were two types of smart people. There were smart people that make you feel dumb, and smart people that, if only for the moment you were standing next to them, you felt like you were lifting up toward their level. Working with the later type is so much fun.

To experience scenius in a small way, all you need is a few people being together in flow. A few key individuals of exceptional talent and the right mindset can anchor a scene that grows and sustains itself. The key is that it's a shared experience. “Genius is individual, scenius is communal.”
