Extra Heart

Once a boy was born with an extra heart.

Did you know, the heart pumps seven thousand liters per day?
Branching vessels could envelop the earth?
Three billion beats make up a lifetime?

The boy wasn't supposed to live, but he did.
The extra heart beat erratically, but never failed.
He grew to be kind and gentle, righteous but wise beyond years.

Doctors advised that the extra heart be removed, that he risked clots, bleeding, and blockage.
Instead, the boy's face still glowed well into old age and his children and grandchildren had extra hearts, too.
