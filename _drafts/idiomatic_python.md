# Idiomatic Python

Here are a few great resources for writing idiomatic Python code.

I highly recommend all Raymond Hettinger's talks. [Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python][3] is old but really good.

[Fluent Python][1] by Luciano Ramalho occupies the same space as Joshua Bloch's classic Effective Java. This book will take you from a competent Python programmer to being proficient with the language.
