## Software-engineering
- Testing
- Logging
- Monitoring
- Code review
- Automated continuous deploy
- Standard project template
- Standards for ops, e.g. terraform, CDK
- [Docs](https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/how-to-write-good-documentation/)
  
## Design
- [functional core, imperative shell](https://gist.github.com/kbilsted/abdc017858cad68c3e7926b03646554e)

## Continuous improvement
- retrospectives on errors / downtime
  - fill gaps in test coverage
  - error handling / retry / recovery

## Machine-learning
- critical analysis of training data
- establish baseline model
- reproducible model training
- reproducible hyperparameter tuning
- model / data provenance
- model assessment
  - post-training
  - in-production
  - held-out test set
  - acquire or label new test sets
  - compare against baseline model
  - real world measures
  - test for unintentional bias
- periodic retraining / online learning

## Data pipelines
- assertions: sanity checks built into processing code
- check pre- and post-conditions


## APIs
- [REST API Guidelines from Microsoft][5]
- example's of excellent API docs:
  - [Stripe's API docs][6]
  - [Github][7]
