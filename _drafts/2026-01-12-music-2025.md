The years are short but the days are long. Another year come and gone. But still, there's music.

Queue up the [2025 playlist][1013] and read my super deep thoughts on music from the year just gone.

## Wellington Jazz

Wellington has had a rough couple of years with the New Zealand government in a phase of austerity. Luckily, the music scene is going strong. Someone at the [New Zealand School of Music][1005] is doing something right, judging by the quality of musicians with associations of one kind or another with the school.

This year, when I wasn't busy at the lab, I got out to hear some talented Wellington musicians work their magic. Most Sundays, you can start out at the [Undercurrent Bookshop][5] at 3:30, then head over to the [Rogue and Vagabond][6] for Sunday Jazz at 5, which is always fun.

2025 was a strong year for the [Wellington Jazz Festival][4] especially where local talent is concerned.

Next year's [Jazz Fest will be October 14-18][4]. In the meantime, keep up with what's on in Welly with their handy [Gig Guides][7].

So much great music is lost into the air, never to be captured again, or so says Eric Dolphy. It's great when some of it gets recorded. A cabal of Wellington Jazzers put out albums in 2025. It's cool to see a group of musicians that play on each others albums, go to each other's shows and clearly push each other further into inspired sonic territory.


### Callum Allardice - Elementa

released January 24, 2025

- [Callum Allardice][1001] - composer, guitar
- Luke Sweeting - piano
- Tom Botting - bass
- Hikurangi Schaverien-Kaa - drums

Composer and guitar player [Callum Allardice][1001] released a quartet album in 2025 full of good stuff. That follows a big-band album [Cinematic Light Orchestra][1003] completed during a [composition residency at Victoria University of Wellington][1004].

Callum played in several combinations during Jazz Fest that featured some strong but as-yet unreleased material, at least as far as my Googling skills can dig up. Song titles I managed to catch included _The Curse_, _The Right Hand of the Blessed_ and _The Left Hand of the Damned_. I hope to hear recordings of these tunes someday soon. Sounds to me like they should be a suite - _The Cursed, the Blessed and the Damned_ - but what do I know?.

Allardice and Sweeting also played together as part of [Antipodes][1009]. They're last release was _Good Winter_ back in 2018. They played under that name along with Jake Baxendale (sax), Tom Botting (bass) and Tim Geldens (drums) for Jazz Fest, then a New Zealand mini-tour that ended up back in Welly again sounding super tight after a few weeks playing together. We can hope some of that material is sitting on a hard drive somewhere waiting to be released.

### Louisa Williamson - Groundwork

<figure style="float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 2em; height: 33%; width: 33%; ">

    alt="Louisa Williamson - Groundwork"

</figure>

[Louisa Williamson][1006] is a sax and flute player, band leader, and composer of jazzy, soulful and funktastic music. This past year's [Groundwork][1008] follows [What Dreams May Come][1007], a five-movement suite for jazz orchestra taking inspiration from Brian Eno and Maria Schneider.

released April 17, 2025

- Louisa Williamson - saxophone/flute/vocals
- Kaito Walley - trombone (In Tune, Lake Glass, Lou Lou)
- Callum Allardice - guitar

### Clear Path Ensemble - Black Sand

I can't beat the official blurb on this one: “Inspired by the deep listening ambient and jazz record bars of Japan, Black Sand continues with Clear Path Ensemble’s jazz-funk fusion sound while folding new elements of minimalism, ambient, techno and library music into a restrained, yet highly exploratory sound world.”

released May 15, 2025

- Cory Champion - drums, percussion, vibraphone, guitar, electric bass, rhodes, synthesizers
- Johnny Lawrence - double bass, electric bass
- Daniel Hayles - piano, rhodes, clavinet
- James Illingworth - synthesizer
- Louisa Williamson - flute
- Mike Isaacs - bass clarinet

When this crew announced they were playing at the Begonia House, I was skeptical. How are you going to have a show in a greenhouse? Well, turns out it's a super cool venue and it was a great show.

### Daniel Hayles - On the Grid

Whether it's solo piano or 17-piece big-band, I always leave a Daniel Hayles gig with homework. He's great at turning up deep cuts that soon make there way onto your playlists.

During Jazz Fest, Daniel led a fantastic performance of the Other Futures Big Band doing a thing they describe as “Turntablism sensibility on a symphonic scale” at Meow Nui. The set list featured works by Stealy Dan, Notorious B.I.G., NZ composer [Jonathan Crayford][1010].

## The Outside World

Out in the wider world across thousands of miles of ocean, things are a mess. A world order is collapsing. But still, good music is being made.
