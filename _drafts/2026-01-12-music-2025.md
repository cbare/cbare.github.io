The years are short but the days are long. Another year come and gone. But still, there's music.

## Wellington Jazz

Wellington has had a rough couple of years with the New Zealand government in a phase of austerity. Luckily, the music scene is going strong. Someone at the New Zealand School of Music is doing something right, judging by the inspired musicians coming out of there.

This year, when I wasn't busy at the lab, I got out to hear some talented Wellington musicians work their magic. Most Sundays, you can start out at the [Undercurrent Bookshop][5] at 3:30, then head over to the [Rogue and Vagabond][6] for Sunday Jazz at 5, which is always fun.

### Wellington Jazz Festival

The [Wellington Jazz Festival][4] was especially strong for local talent in 2025. Next year's [Jazz Fest will be October 14-18][4]. In the meantime, keep up with what's on in Welly with their handy [Gig Guides][7].

![Other Futures Big Band](../images/music/other-futures-big-band.jpg)

So much great music is, as Eric Dolphy said, lost into the air, never to be captured again. So, it's great when some of it gets recorded. A cabal of Wellington Jazzers put out albums in 2025. It's cool to see a group of musicians that play on each others albums, go to each other's shows and clearly push each other further into inspired sonic territory.

### Callum Allardice - Elementa

released January 24, 2025

- Callum Allardice - composer, guitar

- Tom Botting - bass

Callum played some great tunes live that aren't on this release, in particular, _The Curse_, _The Right Hand of the Blessed_ and _The Left Hand of the Damned_. Sounds like a suite to me: _The Cursed, the Blessed, and the Damned_.

### Louisa Williamson - Groundwork
