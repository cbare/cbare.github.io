_“All your dreams of adventure and freedom and discovery culminate...and then you go nowhere but round and round with the same old thoughts going round and round with you.”_

_Orbital_ by Samamtha Harvey is a beautiful and contemplative book. It's a book in which nothing much happens, part of a growing subgenre of such books. The book reaches its climax when all the characters are asleep. Yet, the book covers some important topics - birth, death, new love blossoming, old love fading, climate change, the insignificance of humans and of humanity in total, political division, religion, simple bonds of shared experience... all the important topics.

_“Our lives here are inexpressibly trivial and momentous at once...”_

_“A human being was not made to stand still.”_

For those wondering where the plot is, it's right here:

A love letter to our home planet, “a celebration of the Earth [...] with a pang of loss.” I don't care if you call it a novel or a poem, just do yourself a favor and read it. _Orbital_ is beautiful.
