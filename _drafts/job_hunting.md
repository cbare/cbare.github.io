I draft. Rewrite. Practice. Cut it down. Get feedback. Hone it. Restructure itâ€¦ Then rinse and repeat.

Key questions I reflect on:

ðŸ§  Who's in the audience? What do they need from me?
ðŸ§  How am I going to engage their hearts â€“ not just their minds?
ðŸ§  What am I trying to get across? What will get in the way of that?
ðŸ§  Can I make this better? What have I missed?

And on a practical level:

ðŸ§  Do I know my content inside out?
ðŸ§  How is the room set up? How will I used the space?
ðŸ§  How much time do I have? How will I manage it?
ðŸ§  What tools will I use if I start to lose the audience?
ðŸ§  Can I incorporate audience participation?

Most of us overestimate what we can achieve without prep. And we underestimate what we can achieve *with* prep.
