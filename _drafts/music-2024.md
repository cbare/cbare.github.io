What a great year for music, with an abundance of new releases and newly discovered oldies but goodies.

Streaming services are so good for exploratory listening. Following the threads of “if you liked that, you’ll probally like this...” will lead you down some enjoyable rabbit holes.

Whether streaming music is sustainable for musicians or even technology companies and whether [enshitification][6] takes hold resulting in a flood of [ghost music][7], [fake artists][8], and AI generated dreck, is yet to be seen.

For now, like ocean currents washing up pretty shells onto golden beaches, the algorithms surface plenty of hand-crafted certified-organic tunes and I am grateful to our digital overlords for that.

## Live music

One way to be sure you're getting real human-generated content is to go see it being made in person. Showing up and dropping a bit of disposable income on tickets, drinks, and snacks helps keep the scene alive and let's creative folks know you value what they do. I'm old and lame and don't get out much, but I saw some good shows this year.

There were a few pleasant Sunday afternoons spent taking in a jazz set at [Undercurrent Books](https://www.undercurrent.nz/). Louisa Williamson's Heavy Flow series of shows feature a rotating cast of very talented musicians having fun. I finally got out to see the last one of 2024. Esperanza Spalding graced the 2024 Wellington Jazz Festival with her personality and deep musical chops. Japanese math-rock legends Toe closed out their Oceania tour to a packed house at Meow.

In [Toronto][5], I briefly became a regular at [the Rex][] to listen to a piano trio consisting of Duncan Wilson (p.), Chris Parnis (b.) and Petros Anagnostakos (d.). A trio led by bassist Jesse Dietschi. You can hear the Jess Dietschi Trio's thoughtful chamber jazz on their 2023  album _Gradient_. I also took in a program of Handel, Beethoven, and Prokofiev performed by Vadym Kholodenko at the beautiful Koerner Hall, sort of a journey through time from baroque to high classical to modern.

## Hyperion Records

Hyperion Records was one of the last holdouts to not have their catalog available on streaming services. In February of 2023, Hyperion was acquired by the Universal Music Group and in the later half of that year their deep and wonderful catalog started appearing on streaming services.

It's hard to do justice, but, for me, the highlights are Angela Hewitt's gorgeous piano playing. She's known for Bach, but there's so much more, in particular her sweetening of Ravel's complex piano pieces. Also, Stephen Hough's playing of Mompou and Lívia Rév's of Debussy.


## Dorian Dumont

If you've had a years-long obsession with Aphex Twin covers on accoustic instruments - _and who hasn't?_ - you might have been a bit giddy when Brussells-based piantist Dorian Dumont released a _second_ album of Aphex Twin covers.

Dumont's lush and meditative version of Rhubarb is a highlight, infused with scattered raindrops of dissonance precipitated from Bill Evan's Peace Piece. Windowlicker morphs into a banger of a piano sonata. The glitchy stuff recalls Webyrn.

## New Discoveries

Not necessarily new, but new to me.

The Garden Suite by Nitai Hershkovits & Daniel Dor is a unique piece of music. Maybe if Frank Zappa and Aphex Twin had collaborated on the soundtrack to a Studio Ghibli film, it might sound something like this.


## Pluto by O'Higgins & Luft

Saxophonist Dave O’Higgins & guitarist Rob Luft recorded an album of Monk and Coltrane covers in 2018.
