## Dorian Dumont

If you've had a years long obsession with Aphex Twin covers on accoustic instruments - and who hasn't? - you might have been a bit giddy when Brussells-based piantist Dorian Dumont released a _second_ album of Aphex Twin covers.

Windowlicker becomes a piano sonata. Dumont's lush and meditative version of Rhubarb is another highlight, infused with scattered raindrops of dissonance precipitated from Bill Evan's Peace Piece.

Electronic glitch morphs into Webyrn-like
