Large Language Models Still Can't Plan
Valmeekam et al, 2023
https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10498

As an undergraduate computer science student, I can remember being told that every problem in computer science could be solved with a giant lookup table. At some other time, I was also told that every problem in computer science could be solved by adding a another level of indirection. Large language models are giant lookup tables with a many layers of indirection.
