Test-Time Adaptation



Intelligence is a process and skill is the output of that process.

Intelligence is the efficiency with which you operationalize the past to face a constantly changing future.

The complexity and variability of any domain is the result of the repetition, composition, transformation, instantiation of a small number of kernels of structure. The number of unique atoms of meaning that you need to describe it is very small.

Intelligence is that ability to mine your experience to identify these atoms of meaning that can be reused across many different situations, across many different tasks. This involves identifying invariants, structures, and principles. These building blocks, these atoms, are called abstractions.

You make sense of a new situation by recombining on the fly abstractions from your collection to create a new model adapted to the situation. Efficiency is a factor. How efficienty do you acquire new abstractions and how efficiently can you recombine them to navigate novelty?

type 1 abstraction:

- perception
- intuition
- approximation
- "abstraction" in art

Type 2 abstraction

- reasoning
- planning
- rigor
- "abstraction" in cs

Transformers are great at type 1 abstraction. Search is good for type 2 abstraction. Program systhesis from input/output pairs by combinatorial search suffers from combinatorial explosion.

Human reasoning is heavily guided by perception and intuition. We intuit where to go then only discretely enumerate a small number of options. We use fast-but-maybe-wrong judgment calls to keep combinatorial explosion in check.
