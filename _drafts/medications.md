This article on [Making Sense of Drug Classification](https://www.verywellhealth.com/drug-classes-1123991) is a great place to start.

There are at least four different ways of classifying medications:

* *indication or therapeutic use*, meaning the types of condition they are used to treat
* *mechanism of action*, meaning the specific biochemical reaction that occurs when you take a drug
* *mode of action*, meaning the specific way in which the body responds to a drug
* *chemical structure*

The [ATC classification system](https://www.whocc.no/atc/structure_and_principles/) from the World Health Organization (WHO) classifies substances into a hierarchy with five levels.

[RxNorm](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/) provides normalized names for clinical drugs and links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software, including those of First Databank, Micromedex, Gold Standard Drug Database, and Multum. The web interface for RxNorm is [RxNav](https://mor.nlm.nih.gov/RxNav/search?searchBy=String&searchTerm=metoprolol).

[RxClass](https://mor.nlm.nih.gov/RxClass/) is a classification maintained by the US NLM.
