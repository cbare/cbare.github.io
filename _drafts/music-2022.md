## Collecting covers of Aphex Twin songs

Electronic music flourished during the 1990's and early 2000's, producing works of lasting value such as Aphex Twin's _Ambient Works_, Boards of Canada's _Music Has the Right to Children_ and Radiohead’s _Kid A_. It's a tribute to their compositional quality that Aphex Twin tunes have been so often covered across disparate styles - jazzy, Romantic, modernist.

- _Nannou_ The New Talent Jazz Orchestra (featuring Taylor Haskins) 2003
- _Alberto Balsalm_ on Taylor Haskins _Recombination_ (2009)
- _NANNOU_ and _Polynomial - C_ covered by Jazz pianist Dorian Dumont (2021)
- _Avril 14th > Nannou2_ by Brad Walker	Quintet (2014)
- _Flim_ The Bad Plus _These Are the Vistas_ (2003)
- _Avril 14th_ Olga Scheps (2019)
- _Jynweythek Ylow_ Alarm Will Sound (2005). AWS lean into the percussive nature of the work bringing it somewhere in the direction of Bartok or Webern.
- [Rhubarb beautifully arranged for guitar and cello][101] and [Jynweythek Ylow for guitar, mandolin, and cello][102] performed—all intruments—by Youtuber who goes by “Run on Music”.
- [Performances and transcriptions of _Avril 14th_ and _Jynweythek Ylow_ by Megan L. Nell aka Lapsura][103].
