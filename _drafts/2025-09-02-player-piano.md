I heard somewhere that _Player Piano_ by Kurt Vonnegut was the books we should all be reading because we are living in its world.

After finishing it, I see the point, but not entirely.

Kurt Vonnegut (1922 – 2007) attended Cornell University in upstate New York but dropped out and enlisted. He was trained in mechanical engineering by the army.

He was captured and was a POW in Dresden in 1944.

After the war, Vonnegut was hired as a technical writer at GE. After publishing a few short stories, he quit to become a full time writer.

His first first novel, Player Piano, was published in 1952.
