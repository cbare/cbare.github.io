Remote work has become part of the new normal. Many “knowledge workers” say they'll never go back. But what about the next step? Organizations distributed across national boundaries and time zones - async international remote.

As an American expat living in lovely extra-remote New Zealand, it's more than a passing interest.

Async international remote is still a big ask for most employers, but that's changing fast. A few pioneering companies are blazing the trail. More will follow.

AirBnB CEO Brian Chesky: “Today’s startups have embraced remote work and flexibility, and I think this will become the predominant way that we all work 10 years from now. This is where the world is going.”

One sticky point is pay equity. “Location based pay is killing my motivation” was the complaint that started a recent thread on Hacker News. Sitting virtually side-by-side doing the same work but with a drastic pay gap is sure to generate some friction.

For many companies, hiring internationally sounds scary. What about taxes? International employment law? This is where a global employer of record comes in handy, for example:

U.S. focused job sites like Hired and AngelList don't provide a good way to say you live in location X but want to work for companies in location Y. I heard that Hired considers international remote a growth area and is working toward better support.
