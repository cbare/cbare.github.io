## Data driven healthcare requires quantifying patients.
“Sadly, very bad news about what the healthcare system has done so far about data capture. They did not think about long term secondary uses of data.”

Language assays - output targeted structured data:
 - rationale for treatment choices
 - topics covered in patient encounters
 - complex symptom descriptions
 - social and behavioral elements
 - patient health goals
 - patient diaries for diet, exercise, symptoms
 - measure everyday life to understand mental health
