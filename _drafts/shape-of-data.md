We wrote a paper about data structures in the domian of systems biology and how they join together.

This was an obscure paper in a niche field and largely passed unnoticed. But it did garner a tweat from someone calling themself Potty Theron who described out work as “Arrogant in their ecentricity”, which I found endlessly amusing.

In case you're wondering what systems biology is... Well, if you take the view that important properties emerge from the interaction of parts and apply it to molecular biology, you have an approach to understanding the complex biological systems like cells, organisms, and ecosystems.

Our claim was that a lot of biology can be captured in a computable way by a handful of data structures that join together by a set of common keys. And further, that finding data structures and their join-points is a modeling strategy that generalizes across domains.

Imagine how many types of data come together in Google Maps that join on lat. and long. Or financial and textual data about corporations that join on stock ticker symbol. Facebook is built on propagating information across a friend graph.
