Everything we know comes to us through our senses and we know our senses lie. Worse yet, we selectively integrate perception into memory. What we remember or forget and how we reconstruct hazy recollections are biased and faulty. We are the unreliable narrators of our own stories.

That's not to say that objective reality doesn't exist. Just that our ability to percieve it and hold it in our minds is limited.

In medical training, clinicians and psychologists use the term insight in a very specific way.

“A patient's awareness of illness, ability to attribute symptoms to the illness, recognition of the consequences of symptoms, and appreciation of the need for treatment.”


Working with patients with impaired insight.

Insight, at “normal” levels of function, 

ability to perceive deeper truths about ourselves, others, and situations.

Perception of personal cognitive process, motivations, emotions, strengths, weaknesses, and limitations should enable effective behavioral regulation and drive self-improvement.

We're not seeing reality. We are inferring reality as best we can through the amazing but finite instruments at our disposal. Our brains take input from our senses and try to decide what it means and whether it matters.

As a species, we're adept at extending our senses. Optical lenses help astronomers understand things that are very far away and biologist see things that are very small. The existence of invisible planets and black holes can be inferred by the wobble in the orbits of things that can be seen.

Vision is something humans are quite good at. We're not particulary good at thinking probabilistically. Machine learning models find patterns in millions of data points in high-dimensional spaces for which our brains aren't well-equiped.
