title:  "History of flight and American power"
category: History
tags: history technology
---


My Grand-Dad was born in 1897 and lived to just over 90 in 1988. Within the span of that life, aviation went from Kitty Hawk to the Concorde. As a young man, he went to Wichita, the nearest city, for the first time on horseback.

It's worth pondering the transformation of the world during that span of time. It used to be said that we would not see that kind of rapid leap forward again. People say that less these days. AI appears to be on a transformative trajectory. 

Over that time, America went from an emerging industrial and technological power to the preeminent global superpower. Aviation was a key enabler of that process. Like AI, aviation is a duel use technology. Aircraft deliver overwhelming force and vacationing families to all corners of the world.

Might we derive some insight from a consideration of how aviation evolved and interacted with economics and power? And might that insight inform our understanding of how the current AI revolution will play out as we are swept along by another wave of technological change.

From today's point of view, it seems likely that AI will enrich our personal lives, reconfigure our economy, and radically change the balance of power in the world. What follows is something of a photo-essay through which I hope to build some intuition relevant to a technology that many believe will be one of the most significant ever in our private lives and in the lives of empires.

We'll see a lot of military hardware. This is not because I'm a big believer in the valor and the glory of war. I'm a bigger fan of building, discovery, and innovation. Also, this is an American-centered point of view - first, because I'm American. But also, America still leads the global system, as of this writing.


## November 21, 1783

The first manned hot-air balloon, designed by the Montgolfier brothers, takes off from the Bois de Boulogne, Paris, on November 21, 1783. The pilots, Pilatre De Rozier and the Marquis d’Arlandes, flew over Paris for about 20 minutes and traveled 5 miles, landing safely between two windmills on the outskirts of the city. They were preceded by a test flight crewed by a sheep, a duck and a rooster.

## 1916 First Boeing aircraft

The B&W was the very first Boeing aircraft, designed and built by William E. Boeing and Conrad Westervelt, which had its first flight on June 15, 1916.

## Interwar period

Aircraft evolved from World War I-style biplanes into sleek, high-performance airliners. A solid infrastructure took shape under government guidance through the Post Office and the Commerce Department, and regulatory reforms reshaped the industry. 

### Air Mail

The U.S. Post Office was an early customer of nascent airline companies.

In 1926, single-engined, open-cockpit Swallow biplanes were used by Varney Air Lines, a predecessor of United Air Lines, to open the first privately-contracted air mail route of the nation between Pasco, Washington, and Elko, Nevada. The pilot was Leon D. Cuddenback, now with the Civil Aeronautics Administration in Seattle.

### 1927 Lindbergh crosses the Atlantic

On May 21, 1927, at 10:22 p.m. local time, 25-year-old Charles Lindbergh and his silver monoplane, the Spirit of St. Louis, landed in Paris, France, making him the first aviator to successfully fly nonstop across the Atlantic from New York to Paris.

### September, 1928

LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin was 236.6m long and carried a crew of 36 plus 24 passengers. It made 590 flights between 1928 to 1937. It was the longest and largest airship in the world when it was built. It made the first circumnavigation of the world by airship, and the first nonstop crossing of the Pacific Ocean by air and provided a commercial passenger and mail service between Germany and Brazil between 1932 and 1937.

### United Airlines

[Passenger service took root and grew][125], and air routes spread across the country. But because air travel was so expensive, only the wealthy and business travelers flew.

## First helicopter flight

September 14, 1939, the VS-300, the world's first practical helicopter, took flight in Stratford, Connecticut, designed and piloted by Igor Sikorsky.

## 1939-1945 WW2

In 1905, Japan became the first non-European power to win a major military victory over a European nation.

The Jet Age began for civilian passengers in Britain in 1952 with the first scheduled flight of the de Havilland Comet. Pan American began service on the New York to Paris route with the Boeing 707 on October 26, 1958. The following year was the first in which more transatlantic passengers traveled by air than by sea.

[The B-52][117] is a long-range, heavy bomber that is capable of flying at high subsonic speeds at altitudes up to 50,000 feet (15,166.6 meters). It can carry nuclear or precision guided conventional ordnance with worldwide precision navigation capability.

## Vietnam War

[The Vietnam War is known as the “Helicopter War.”][112] In total, nearly 12,000 helicopters saw action in Vietnam. The young men who flew those helicopters—many of them only 19 or 20 years old—had “absolutely the most dangerous jobs in the war,” he adds.

## Concorde

![Concorde](../images/history-of-flight/Concorde-Supersonic.jpg)

Aérospatiale/BAC Concorde was a British-French supersonic passenger jet airliner. It had a maximum speed of Mach 2.04 (1,354 mph or 2,180 km/h at cruise altitude, over twice the speed of sound), with seating for 92 to 128 passengers. The aircraft entered service in 1976 and continued flying for the next 27 years.

Twenty Concorde aircraft were built with 14 in commercial service.

Most are now in museums. The [one on display in Seattle's Museum of Flight][107] flew the last British Airways commercial Concorde flight, from New York to London, on October 24, 2003.

Strike groups are a principal element of projection of U.S. power. A single supercarrier holds enough firepower to rival the air forces of entire nations. There are 11 carrier strike groups in the U.S. Navy.

## The present moment

Another ambitious power is rising.


The [balance of power shifts][128] over time.



“The Typhoons currently deployed as part of 903 Expeditionary Air Wing joined Egyptian Air Force F-16s during Exercise BRIGHT STAR.  This was the first time since 2001 that the RAF have flown with the Egyptian Air Force. T he Typhoons were also joined on the exercise by F-16s from the Greek Air Force and US Air Force F-15s and F-16s together with C-130 Hercules and B-52s.”
