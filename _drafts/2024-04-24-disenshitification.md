In the old days, it was commonly believed that the internet would spread knowledge, give voice to the marginalized, and create a more interconnected world which would naturally tend towards freedom, democracy, empowerment, and enlightment. We all know now that this viewpoint was naive. The same channels carry propoganda, scams, snake oil, misinformation, disinformation, hate, and all sorts of ugliness.

Corporations profit from engagement, and it just so happens that our little monkey brains find divisive, enraging, and generally toxic content highly engaging. This process has become known as "enshitification" possibly after the strategy of right-wing propogandists self-described as "flood the zone with shit."

But the original spirit survives. “...the best content on the internet is created by people who have turned research into their leisure activity,” says Celine Nguyen, in her essary [research as a leisure activity][4].
