2023 was the year that the covid induced listening wave tapered off a bit. I recorded listening to 7,347 tracks, compared to over 10 thousand in each of the previous 3 years. I listened to exceptionally little music in the last half of the year. Is this a symptom or a cause of being depressed?

## GoGo Penguin

On the plus side, I took the whole fam to see [GoGo Penguin open the Wellington Jazz Festival][5] in October. I've seen them once before in Seattle and was even more impressed this time. They're new album, _Everything Is Going to Be OK_ was my most played album of 2023.

## Greg Reitan

My favorite new discovery of 2023 is L.A.-based pianist [Greg Reitan][1], who plays deep-thinking jazz in a trio setting. Reitan is a graduate of USC Thornton School of Music as are bandmates bassist Jack Daro and drummer Dean Korba. Like Bill Evans, Reitan plays harmonically sophisticated music with melodic charm. _Some Other Time_, _Antibes_, _Post No Bills_, _Daybreak_ and _West 60th_ all ranked highly in the most played of 2023.

## Snarky Puppy and Bill Laurance

[Snarky Puppy][3]'s _Empire Central_, released in late 2022, was near the top of my personal chart. Due to that album being so good, I got into [Bill Laurance][4]'s solo material which just keeps growing on me.

## New Zealand musicians

For a small town at the far end of the Earth, Wellington has a pretty good music scene. At some point in 2023, I wondered through the Hub at Victoria University and had the good fortune to hear [Daniel Hayles][6], [Louisa Williamson][8], Seth Boy, and a drummer (?) playing Poinciana in tribute to Ahmad Jamal. Of course, I stayed for the full set. Later, I heard Hayles play an eclectic [set at Classical on Cuba][7].

[Louisa Williamson][8] is a talented sax player, composer, and band leader. Her _What Dreams May Come_ has joined my growing rotation of Big Band Jazz alongside albums by Miho Hazama and Jihye Lee.

## Staples

My staple listening is jazz from the late 50's and early 60's - Bill Evans, Miles Davis, Coltrane - and classical piano - András Schiff, Alexandre Tharaud, and Pascal Rogé.
