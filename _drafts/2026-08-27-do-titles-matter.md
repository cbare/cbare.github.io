Do titles matter?

I was prompted to think about this question by this article linked on Hacker News the other day: _Titles matter_ by Josh Collinsworth. Josh writes a good article, but it's mistitled. That article addressed the question, “What’s your definition of a web developer?” in context of LLMs that are arguable pretty good web developers. 

In the beginning, by which I mean the 1980's, we were the rejects. People went into tech because they were smart, but had buck teeth and coke-bottle glasses and were never going to succeed as a corporate climber. Being rejected by the system, we rejected the premise.

Right through to today, tech culture rebels against the rigid hierarchy of old school corporations and bureaucracy. Snarky titles like _Rock Star_ or _Ninja_ poke fun at ridiculous status games. A core belief is that what you can do or build matters more than your family name, your expensive cloths, or a line of trophies on your shelf.



Then tech bro's showed up.

Merit.

Humans are tribal animals. We are trapped in the bodies of apes that only recently crawled out of the bush, pulled on a pair of jeans and a hoodie, and bought an iphone.

I've always disliked the phrase “doesn’t meet the bar.” It sneakily implies a simple objective criterion where no such thing exists. Bar raisers.


Building and discovery are “infinite games”, while status is zero-sum.

What determines why some people get praise and promotions? Or the best projects? Or access to mentorships, training, and resources. And why do others, perhaps equally smart and capable, don't get those things?

Titles matter if they matter to the people around you. If you're in a company where titles matter, the unfortunate fact is that _titles matter_.
