I've worked in lots organizations with fairly typical levels of dysfunction and one that could in fairness be described as toxic. But how do you identify a toxic environment? How is that environment created and maintained?

Human beings are a tribal animal and as such our instincts are to form groups and establish hierarchy. Those instincts can work in our favor in cases where the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts or can be exploited against our interests as individuals or as unfavored subgroups.


## Addressing Power Structures and Changing Social Climates

The term “[master suppression techniques][2]” was introduced by Norwegian psychologists Ingjald Nissen and Berit Ås to describe strategies of social manipulation by which a dominant group maintains their position by undermining others.

To some degree, these domination techniques are default human behaviors that happen mostly unconsciously. It takes conscious effort to push back against the worst in our natures. When leaders practice these behaviors and, by example, give others license to do so, things get especially ugly.

It's important to realize that the same environment can be experienced differently by different people. If you're in the _in_ group, you're having a different experience from those in the _out_ group. Your mileage may vary along the axes of experience, skillset, gender, ethnicity, personality, etc. The same environment might be great for seniors but bad for juniors, great for engineering but bad for data science.

To counter these behaviors and foster positive social change, the *Empowerment Network at Stockholm University* proposes **counterstrategies** to combat dominance techniques and **affirmation techniques** to promote healthier social climates. Below is a translation (thanks GPT4o) and summary of their paper _[Bekräftartekniker och motstrategier - sätt att bemöta maktstrukturer och förändra sociala klimat][1]_.


### Dominance Techniques and Counterstrategies

1. **Invisibility**

   - *Technique*: Marginalizing people by ignoring or diminishing their contributions, not acknowledging their name or ideas, talking over someone in a meeting.
   - *Counterstrategy*: **Take Space** – Assert yourself calmly and confidently, address the behavior directly, and demand recognition.
   - *Affirmation Technique*: **Visibility** – Actively acknowledge others by listening, responding, and being constructive.

2. **Ridicule**

   - *Technique*: Mocking or belittling.
   - *Counterstrategy*: **Question** – Challenge ridicule with calm, logical responses, and directly address demeaning remarks.
   - *Affirmation Technique*: **Respect** – Take others seriously. Be supportive and make everyone feel valued.

3. **Withholding Information**

   - *Technique*: Deliberately excluding individuals from access to important information or decision-making processes, limiting their ability to act effectively, e.g., not inviting to an important meeting.
   - *Counterstrategy*: **Demand Transparency** - call out patterns of exclusion.
   - *Affirmation Technique*: **Transparency** – Open and inclusive decision-making processes.

4. **Double-bind**

   - *Technique*: Criticizing individuals no matter their choice. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
   - *Counterstrategy*: **Break the Pattern** – Own your choices without internalizing the imposed conflict, acknowledge trade-offs, define priorities.
   - *Affirmation Technique*: **Double Reward** – Support individual choices. Open many paths to success.

5. **Blame and Shame**

   - *Technique*: Making individuals feel responsible for situations beyond their control, internalizing blame and undermining self-esteem. Public criticism.
   - *Counterstrategy*: **Intellectualize** – Reflect on guilt and shame. Identifying external sources. Don't internalize. Define your own standards and live by them.
   - *Affirmation Technique*: **Affirm Yourself and Others** – Be positive and supportive. Emphasize validation and mutual respect. Own success and failure collectively.


### Conclusions

By identifying and countering dominance techniques, individuals can take control of their circumstances and contribute to establishing a healthier workplace. These methods are practical tools to improve interaction patterns and norms.

If you find yourself in a truly toxic environment, the best thing to do is leave. But, every organization has some level of dysfunction. Creating the kind of working life we want takes effort. If we want a good working environment, we have to play a part in making it good. Falling into negative behaviors is easy and contagious. We have to be mindful, set a good example, and expect the same of those around us.
