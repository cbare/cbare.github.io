We might imagine the many ways in which our limited view of things differs from the pristine God's-eye view. Which variables are important and can we observe them? Are we confused by many irrelevant variables? For those that we can observe, prehaps we observe them through a lens that is noisy, distorted and censored. For those we can't, are there reasonable proxies and what distortions are imposed by using such surrogates?
