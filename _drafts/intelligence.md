“Intelligence is quickness to apprehend as distinct from ability, which is capacity to act wisely on the thing apprehended.” ― Alfred North Whitehead

What is a parts list of a mind?

- intelligence
    - fluent use of language
    - reasoning
    - learning from examples
- memory
    - recall of factual knowledge
- intention
- consciousness

At least we can define memory. Intelligence, intent or agency, and especially consciousness lack a rigorous definition. We have only a vague measure of intelligence and no units of intent or degrees of consciousness.

One important and overlooked lesson of the revolution in language models is that intelligence is separable from the other pieces.
