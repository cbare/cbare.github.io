## Gene2vec

[Gene2vec: distributed representation of genes based on co-expression][9]

Jingcheng Du, Peilin Jia, Yulin Dai, Cui Tao, Zhongming Zhao & Degui Zhi at The University of Texas School of Biomedical Informatics, Houston

In this nifty paper, they've followed the word2vec recipe to produce gene embeddings based on coexpression, defined as pearson correlation >= 0.9 across a set of expression arrays extracted from GEO.

Limitations:

- only based on coexpression, which misses other dimensions of gene similarity - sequence similarity, protein-protein interaction, related function, phenotypic outcomes, location within cell...

- discretized coexpression loses information. Why not use the Glove method (log ratios of co-occurrence??) to produce vectors of desired dimension?



## Mathematics of Machine Learning

I tried to find some smart person to explain [The Modern Mathematics of Deep Learning][5]. Apparently, all such people were too smart to get roped into such a thing. Since the [background to understand this paper][7] is miles over my head, maybe it's better to start with the basics.
