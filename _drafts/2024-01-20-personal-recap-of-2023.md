# 2023 Recap

While the foundations of the World crumble, we're hanging out in New Zealand. We got residency in 2022 and will be able to apply for permanent residency in June of 2024. Jane plans on finishing high school at Wellington Girl's College. She's got 2024 and 2025 to go. Then our baby girl will be off to university, here in NZ or elsewhere. Also, Henry has two years left of primary school.

Jen's Mom came to New Zealand. We traveled to Rotorua and Whitianga in the Coromandel for a couple days of beach and kayaking in Cathedral Cove. We drove into the Coromandel in a heavy rainstorm and left with Cyclone Gabrielle approaching.

Jen and Phil organized a backpacking trip for Henry's birthday to Haurangi Hut by the Orangorango river. I took Henry on an Auckland trip to see the musical Hamilton.

I took a class in Artificial Intelligence from VicU (AI420) and wrote a pretty solid [paper on large language models][].

Summer trip to Seattle. We explored southern Washington State with the Clinton-Manville crew and Sheena and Joel. Hung out with Bill. Stopped for a couple of days in Oregon. Saw some peeps and favorite places. Gave our old Queen Anne house a little TLC.

After the long break in Seattle, I became increasingly disengaged at work, as it became clearer that our group will continue to be powerless and have no ability to deploy code. To the very limited extent that Volpara is becoming more modern in it's processes, the benefits will flow to us last, if at all. In December, they announced that the company was being acquired by Lunit, a Korea A.I. company - the best possible outcome for Volpara at this point. It does me no immediate good at all, but might eventually lead to opportunities for me. I feel increasingly weighed down by baggage at Volpara.
