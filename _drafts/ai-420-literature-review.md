Hi Heitor,

Here are my topic ideas for the literature review essay. I'd like to dig into the exciting recent progress in NLP and am interested in applications in health care, since I've spent a number of years working in that space. I'm not sure whether it's better to cover foundational knowledge on LLMs first, or dive right in to medical use cases. Either could be interesting.
