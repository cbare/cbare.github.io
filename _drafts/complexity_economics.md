Alfred Marshall’s famous dictum in 1890 that “the Mecca of the economist lies in economic biology.”58

“All the sciences are shedding their certainties, embracing openness and process, and asking how structures or phenomena come into being. There is no reason that economics should differ in this regard. Complexity economics sees the economy not as mechanistic, static, timeless and perfect but as organic, always creating itself, alive and full of messy vitality.”
