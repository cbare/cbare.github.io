## Types of companies


### Modern technology companies

Silicon-valley-like model. Modern dev practices. High autonomy. Lateral communication. CICD.

### Traditional hierarchical companies

Top-down, hierarchical. Division between workers and decision makers. Communication mostly up the chain of command.

Processes and engineering dominated by the eccentricities of 1 or 2 individuals.


## Practices that matter

- testing
- code review
- CI/CD
- iteration
- logging and monitoring
- direct interaction with other ICs and especially with end-users
