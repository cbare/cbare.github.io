Notes on [Hadley Wickham][2]'s 2014 paper “[Tidy Data][1]” that lays out the philosophy behind the [tidyverse][101] suite of tools in R.

## Philosophy of Data

The paper describes a structure and semantics of datasets that facilitates manipulation, visualization, and modeling, in short a philosophy of data.

### Variables

Variables often have relationships between them, such as “_z_ is a linear combination of _x_ and _y_”.

### Observations

Obserservations are often grouped then aggregations computed and compared.

### Tidy Data

Tidy Data is:

1. Variables are in columns
2. Observations are in rows
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table

...closely related to Codd's 3rd Normal Form.

### Messy data

Common pathologies of messy data:

- Column headers are values
- Multiple variables are stored in a single column
- Variables are stored in both rows and columns
- Multiple types of observations are stored in one table
- A single observational unit is split into multiple tables

### Tools

### Manipulation

Common data manipulations:

- filter
- transform (computed variables)
- aggregate
- sort
- join


#### Modeling

Modeling typically creates a mapping between sets of predictors and responses.

Model output is unique to the type of model: compare the coefficients of a linear model with the structure representing a random forest.
