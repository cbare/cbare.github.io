I spent a few minutes with Henry on a blue-sky morning in the southern-hemisphere autumn cuddled up on the futon listening to a piece of music, a version‡ of Aphex Twin's Avril 14th played by a jazz quartet. His head resting on my shoulder, we quietly absorbed the way the melody sounded on saxophone rather than piano and the pretty embelishments of the upright bass.

Cicadas hummed and crackled like electric wires in the bush. I tried to radiate something towards my little boy, on the brink of 8 years old, on his way to becoming a fully formed person — something that would stay with him, the knowledge in his core that he was a loved child.

We want our children to keep something from us when we're gone, when they're grown and the world tries to grind them down, crush their spirits. Something that won't give in, something resilient, solid, like heartwood. Fall down seven times, get up eight. So many worries for what the future holds sit beside so much hope. If you love anxiety, you'll love parenthood.

The song ends and he's off to school with a big grin, oversized backpack, scuffed up sneakers, mop of hair, ready to face the day. Whoever said, “Life is short, but the days are long” had it right. I hope that little guy makes his way in the world, that world doesn't fall apart too badly while he's in it, and that he remembers his Dad once in a while.
