I spent a few minutes with Henry of a blue-sky morning in the southern autumn cuddled up on the futon listening to a piece of music, a version‡ of Aphex Twin's Avril 14th played by a jazz quartet. We lay, his head on my shoulder, quietly absorbing the way the melody sounded on the saxophone rather than the piano and the pretty embelishments of the upright bass.

Cicadas hummed and crackled like electric wires in the bush. I tried to radiate something towards my little boy, on the brink of 8 years old, on his way to becoming a fully formed person—something that would stay with him, the knowledge in his core that he was loved as a child.

I want Henry to keep something from me when he's grown and I'm gone, when the world tries to grind him up and crush his spirit, something the won't give in. So many worries for what the future holds sit beside so much hope. If you love anxiety, you'll love parenthood.

The song ends and he's off to school with a big grin, oversized backpack, scuffed up sneakers, mop of hair, ready to face the day. Whoever said, “Life is short, but the days are long” had it right. I hope that little guy makes his way in the world, that world doesn't fall apart too badly while he's in it, and that he remembers his Dad once in a while.
