I'm mildly obsessed with Shenzhen-based digital-health “unicorn” iCarbonX. Checking up on them is partly an exercise in what-could-have been. My former company, Arivale, had a relationship with iCarbonX that might have born fruit if the world had taken a different course.

A few years ago in a different world, in an era of cross-border deals between American & Chinese tech companies, iCarbonX CEO Jun Wang started piecing together a digital health alliance encompassing the spectrum of 'omics, including:
- SomaLogic (proteomics)
- PatientsLikeMe
- HealthTell (immune profiling)
- a couple microbiome partners

In 2016, iCarbonX raised $200M, including $155M from Tencent and commissioned a gorgeous headquarters building in Shenzhen that spoke of grand ambitions. https://www.stevenholl.com/project/icarbonx-headquarters/

I doubted it was ever going to get built, considering trade-war, pandemic, China's tech crackdown, etc. But, it looks like construction has gotten underway. https://www.stevenholl.com/construction-report-icarbonx-headquarters/

Over the last couple years, iCarbonX announced partnerships with a life insurer and seems to be trying to seed a Guangdong regional biotech hub.

A team from iCarbonX won a DREAM Challenge for modeling Single Cell Signaling in Breast Cancer.
