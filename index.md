Building software tools that enhance the ability to create and discover. Machine learning and software engineering applied to life-sciences and human health.

Currently:
* ...looking for the next thing, [remotely]({% post_url 2020-08-30-nz %})...

Formerly:
* Applying machine learning to on-demand text-based primary care medicine at [98point6][8].
* Creating a software platform for health and wellness at [Arivale][1].
* Building tools for open science and reproducible research at [Sage Bionetworks][2].
* Crowdsourcing answers to biomedical questions with [DREAM challenges][3].
* Reverse-engineering the regulation of gene expression at the [Institute for Systems Biology][4].
* [publications][5] (ORCID: [0000-0003-1006-1491][9]).

This is my **[online notebook][7]** - a collection of stuff possibly related to programming, data-science, machine-learning, deep-learning, natural-language-processing, life-science. On any given topic, I might know what I'm talking about or I might just be curious. Mostly, the latter.

Old stuff still lives on the old [Digithead's Lab Notebook][6].
