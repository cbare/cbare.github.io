Building software tools that enhance the ability to create and discover. Machine learning, programming languages, and life-sciences.

Currently:
* ...in between things...

Formerly:
* Applying machine learning to on-demand text-based primary care medicine at [98point6][8].
* creating a software platform for health and wellness at [Arivale][1].
* building for open science and reproducible research at [Sage Bionetworks][2].
* crowdsourcing answers to biomedical questions with [DREAM challenges][3].
* reverse-engineering the regulation of gene expression at the [Institute for Systems Biology][4].
* contributing to research [papers][5].

This is my **[online notebook][7]** - a collection of stuff possibly related to programming, data-science, machine-learning, deep-learning, natural-language-processing, life-science...

Old stuff still lives on the old [Digithead's Lab Notebook][6].
