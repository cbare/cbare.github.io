_A list of projects collecting multi-dimensional health data to be mined for signatures of health and disease._


## Pioneer 100 / Arivale

n<sub>pioneer100</sub> = 108

n<sub>arivale</sub> ≈ 5,000

My former place of employment, Arivale (now deceased) was a start-up based on a pilot study conducted at the Institute for Systems Biology called the Pioneer 100 Project, which was published as
 [A wellness study of 108 individuals using personal, dense, dynamic data clouds][1].

## The Snyder Lab

n = 109

The long list of ventures associated with Michael Snyder include: the [Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine][13], [Qbio][14], [January.ai](https://january.ai/).

In May of 2019, the [Snyder Lab][12] published [A longitudinal big data approach for precision health][4].

Earlier papers with similar themes go back quite a ways, including: [Personal phenotypes to go with personal genomes][16]  (2009), [Personal omics profiling reveals dynamic molecular and medical phenotypes][15] (2012)...

...[Promise of personalized omics to precision medicine][6]  (2013)

![personalized omics fig 2]({{ "/images/nihms414565f2.jpg" | absolute_url }})
{:style="width: 400px; height: 400px;"}

...and [Integrative omics for health and disease
][17]  (2018).


## Human Longevity, Inc.

n = 1,253

“Modern medicine is rapidly moving towards a data-driven paradigm based on comprehensive multimodal health assessments.” [Unsupervised integration of multimodal dataset identifies novel signatures of health and disease][2]

## Verily

n = 10,000 (??)

Verily's Project Baseline is well funded, but is perhaps the most blatant about asking participants to [give up their data with little in return][9].

“Alphabet’s Google division is, fundamentally, in the business of selling data. That is a useful thing to keep in mind when Alphabet’s Verily comes calling for your medical data. But Google is also inarguably useful; this is why, despite knowing that my every move is being tracked by the company, I still make use of Google search, Gmail, and Google Docs, among its other myriad services. Verily’s Project Baseline is, in some sense, the health equivalent of those kinds of services — it has the potential to greatly expand our knowledge about what human health looks like. Not incidentally, the project will be of service to Verily as well.” -[The Verge, April, 2017][10]

Starting in 2017 the multi-year study is expected to cost more than $100 million. Verily's deep molecular profiling includes: “[clinical, molecular, imaging, sensor, self-reported, behavioral, environmental, and other health-related measurements][8].”

## UK Biobank

n = 500,000

[The UK Biobank][7] has genotyped a half-million people along with “biological measurements, lifestyle indicators, biomarkers in blood and urine, and imaging of the body and brain. Follow-up information is provided by linking health and medical records.”

## Etc.

Other studies along the same lines include: [The future of individualized health maintenance][5], [Integration of gut microbiome, host biomarkers, and urine metabolome data reveals networks of interactions associated with distinct clinical phenotypes][3] (aka the China-Denmark study after the affiliations of the authors), and the NIH's [All of Us][11]
