(Updated June, 2019)

The [data-intensive wellness](https://followthedata.wordpress.com/2017/01/05/data-intensive-wellness-companies/) space is getting crowded these days. Lots of companies are forming around the idea that, in one way or another, [data will transform health care](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21736138-welcome-doctor-you-revolution-health-care-coming). We're moving into a world where everything is measured for [better or worse](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/19/news/companies/john-hancock-life-insurance-vitality/index.html). Might instrumenting ourselves like aircraft engines open up new ways to [optimize wellness](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/12/28/572677879/will-gathering-vast-troves-of-information-really-lead-to-better-health)?

One dimension of the [personal health data cloud](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3870) is genetics. A group at the Broad Institute [says](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0183-z), "We propose that it is time to contemplate the inclusion of polygenic risk prediction in clinical care."

The [New York Times write-up on the researcher's findings](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/health/genetic-test-heart-disease.html) makes this point in relation to polygenic risk scoring for cardiovascular disease, "DNA is not destiny [...]. A healthy lifestyle and cholesterol-lowering medications can substantially reduce risk of heart attack, even in those who have inherited a genetic predisposition." Activity, diet and other lifestyle factors are also important dimensions.

[![Number of people tested by consumer genetics companies]({{ "/images/consumer_genomics.png" | absolute_url }})](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610233/2017-was-the-year-consumer-dna-testing-blew-up/)

Health-care is not easy. [Big tech firms](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21736193-worlds-biggest-tech-firms-see-rich-opportunity-health-care-which-could-mean-empowered) like Microsoft and Google have tried their hand only to pull back when faced with complex economics and a byzantine regulatory environment. It is not without reason that the existing medical system has resisted the idea of a bunch of tech-bros moving fast and breaking things.

Recent moves, especially [Amazon's](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/amazon-web-services-exec-were-interested-longitudinal-health-records-analytics-and-pop-health), might prove to be [better conceived](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/05/why-apple-alphabet-amazon-can-win-health-care.html).

### A grab-bag of health-tech

The intersection of technology and health, particularly [AI and personalized health](https://www.nanalyze.com/2017/11/8-startups-using-ai-for-personalized-health/) is clearly the way forward but also a bit of a minefield. It's interesting to compare the different approaches companies are taking based on where they're innovating and where they're integrating into the traditional healthcare system. Getting to a workable mix of innovation and integration is key.

Here's an occasionally updated grab-bag of companies that I think are doing interesting things in health-tech.


## 23andMe

[23andMe](https://www.nature.com/news/the-rise-and-fall-and-rise-again-of-23andme-1.22801), the 800-pound gorilla of direct-to-consumer genetics, surpassed [5 million genotyped customers as of May 2018](https://isogg.org/wiki/Autosomal_DNA_testing_comparison_chart) and nabbed [$300 million from GSK](https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-and-23andme-sign-agreement-to-leverage-genetic-insights-for-the-development-of-novel-medicines/).

{:style="float: left; margin: 0px 18px 18px 18px; width: 204px; height: 85px;"}

Seattle-based Arivale spun out of [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5568837/) done at the [Institute for Systems Biology](https://systemsbiology.org/).

[Arivale](https://www.arivale.com/) analyzes genetics, blood chemistries, saliva and microbiome. Coaching by a certified nutritionist helps members understand and act on their results making changes towards healthier eating, exercise and sleep.

![pioneer-100-figure-1]({{ "/images/pioneer-100-figure-1.png " | absolute_url }})

I spent a happy and interesting two years plus a bit as part of the Arivale team. Sadly, Arivel [ran out of runway](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/scientific-wellness-startup-arivale-closes-abruptly-tragic-end-vision-transform-personal-health/) at the end of April.


## AthGene

[Sold](https://gemstonecapital.com/athgene-was-sold-to-nordic-laboratories/) in 2017, Copenhagen based [AthGene](http://www.athgene.com/) was conceived as a genomics service for athletes offering insights into metabolism, nutrition, and fitness.

One smart move was offering to import your 23andMe data. "Discover your bodies natural fitness genetics potential by importing your 23andMe results onto the AthGene platform – for FREE"

[Interview with Yusufa Sey, CEO of AthGene](https://medium.com/journeyxp-learn-hub/interview-with-yusufa-sey-ceo-of-athgene-a-nomad-which-is-reshaping-genetics-and-lifestyle-d99e74ab1363)

Arivale co-founders [Lee Hood and Nathan Price are on the advisory board](https://systemsbiology.org/news/tag/habit-nutrition/). Habit allows import of genetics from 23andMe or AncestryDNA.

* Then again, maybe [personalized nutrition isn’t going to solve our diet problems](https://www.vox.com/2016/11/2/13453434/personalized-diet-nutrition-dna).


## Helix

Helix aims to be an [app store for DNA](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608313/a-dna-app-store-is-here-but-proceed-with-caution/). They're well funded, starting with $100 million from Illumina and closing an [additional $200 million in March](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/01/helix-holds-first-close-on-a-planned-200-million-investment-in-its-genetic-services-marketplace/) in a [series B round](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/helix).


## Human API

[Human API](https://www.humanapi.co/) is a data provider that helps connect applications to sources of health data from medical records, labs, pharmacies, and devices. This is such a smart idea - basically messy difficult data in, cleaner easier data out.


## Human Longevity

Craig Venter's boutique version of 23andMe. [Oops, not Craig Venter's any more.](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/biotech/sd-me-human-longevity-sues-jcvi-20180722-story.html) Under [new management](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/biotech/sd-me-human-longevity-ceo-karow-20180713-story.html), the company is focusing on raising money, lowering cost and scaling.


## iCarbonX

 * [MultiScale Health, aiming to ‘liberate’ healthcare data](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/tech-vets-launch-multiscale-health-aiming-liberate-healthcare-data-real-time-platform/)


## Orig3n

Boston-based [Orig3n](https://orig3n.com/) sells DNA tests related to fitness and nutrition. “Empowering everyone with actionable insights about wellness through DNA Testing...” sounds vaguely familiar. But, not a data play: “Privacy is of the utmost importance at #Orig3n; your data is never sold or shared.”


## Pathway Genomics

Three of [Pathway Genomics](https://www.pathway.com/)'s executives are M.D.'s with another handful of physicians on their advisory board. Their offer is to help "uncover your personal path to a healthier lifestyle" giving "scientifically proven genetic nutrition/fitness guidance". They coach on lifestyle focus areas like nutrition, skin, and weight. On top of that, having doctors on board allows Pathway to operate in medical spaces including mental health, prenatal screening, cancer and heart health.


## Privia Health

[Privia Health](http://www.priviahealth.com/) describe themselves as a "physician practice management and population health technology company". What this seems to mean is providing a Kaiser-like co-ordinated care experience for a network of independent physicians.


## Pursuant Health

Maybe superceded by January.ai?


## SOPHiA

Swiss startup [SOPHiA Genetics](http://www.sophiagenetics.com/en_US/home.html) develops variant analysis technology with the aim of "democratizing Data-Driven Medicine".


## Sema4

[Sema4](https://sema4genomics.com/) is led by Eric Schadt, formerly with Pacific Biosciences and Rosetta Inpharmatics. The company provides genetic screening and counseling while building a health and genomics data pool as a research platform. Their tests include a catalog of rare genetic diseases along with variants relevant to cancer and pharmacogenomics.

"Sema4 is a next generation health information company, spun out of the Mount Sinai Health System, that provides advanced genomic testing and merges big data analytics with clinical diagnostics." "Sema4 is an innovative partnership of scientists, doctors, engineers, and genetic counselors dedicated to empowering healthier living through data."

Sema4 is tightly integrated with it's parent, [Mount Sinai medical center](https://medcitynews.com/2017/06/sema4-mount-sinai/). Its prenatal tests are ordered by physicians. They're also trying the direct-to-consumer route through the Helix platform.


## Thorne Research

Supplement maker [Thorne Research](https://www.thorne.com/) announced a [partnership with Drs. Joel Dudley and Chris Mason](https://www.thorne.com/press-releases/thorne-partners-with-pillar-health), called Pillar Health at first and now called [Onegevity](https://www.onegevityhealth.com/), offering comprehensive analysis of blood, genetic, and microbiome data through an AI platform for precision wellness solutions.

&ldquo;Onegevity will provide a comprehensive molecular portrait and customized recommendations for an individual’s health based on integrated analysis of longitudinal blood, genetics, and gut microbiome profiles.&rdquo;

Dudley of Mount Sinai is a former student of Atul Butte. Christopher Mason is a geneticist at Cornell. Maybe this is in stealth mode, but it's not clear what's come of this besides a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/pillar_health).

In 2016, Thorne acquired [WellnessFX](https://www.wellnessfx.com/) provider of dashboard views of lab tests based on genetics and blood panels. It'll be interesting to see if or how this gets combined with Pillar.
