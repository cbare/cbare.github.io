## Notes

#### Most common data science modeling tasks:
- Classification—Deciding if something belongs to one category or another
- Scoring—Predicting or estimating a numeric value, such as a price or probability
- Ranking—Learning to order items by preferences
- Clustering—Grouping items into most-similar groups
- Finding relations—Finding correlations or potential causes of effects seen in the data
- Characterization—Very general plotting and report generation from data
