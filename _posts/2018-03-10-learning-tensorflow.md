The excellent folks of [GDGSeattle](https://www.meetup.com/gdg-seattle/) and [Seattle-DAML](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-DAML/) put on a couple of workshops on deep learning and Google's [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) package.

Their materials are a great resources.

## Hallucinated Shakespear

Martin has a handful of [tutorials on GitHub](https://github.com/martin-gorner) including the amazing language model RNN-Shakespear.

## Hallucinated Python

Applied to the Python code of TensorFlow itself, after 0.4 epochs of training it looks like this:

![TensorFlow Python 0.4 epochs]({{ "/images/tensorflow_python.png" | absolute_url }})

...and after 12 epochs of training, I say ship it:

![TensorFlow Python 12 epochs]({{ "/images/tensorflow_python_2.png" | absolute_url }})
