[Toronto][7] is the largest city in Canada and 4th largest in North America, with a population of 3 million. The greater Toronto area is home to 6.7 million of Canada's 39 million people. Founded as York in 1793 on [the north shore of Lake Ontario][21] and renamed Toronto in 1834, the city is a center of finance and media and a [major technology hub][8].

I'm going to be in Toronto for two weeks in July for the [Deep Learning + Reinforcement Learning Summer School][30] at the [Vector Institute][31] and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR).

Here are the notes I collected for this time and next on how to enjoy a nice visit to Toronto.
