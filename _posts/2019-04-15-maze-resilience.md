On a deck overlooking Lake Union, the founder of my previous company pitched an idea to a group of us. What if there were people walking around in robust health while carrying a gene thought to condemn them to severe childhood disease? These people should be very sick, but aren't. Finding those people and investigating what's protecting them would be very interesting.

This idea went by the name of the Resilience project. Here's how Mount Sinai Professor Ron Chen's site describes it. “The Resilience Project aims at finding individuals with rare genetic mutations that the medical text books would indicate should have caused catastrophic illness but somehow these individuals are ‘resilient’ – they have been protected via yet to be discovered genetic or environmental factors.”

Analyzing over a half-million genomes, they [found 13 individuals with apparent resilience to Mendelian diseases][1]. Protective variants were not totally unknown previously. See [Modifier genes in Mendelian disorders: the example of cystic fibrosis][3].

Now, at least one start-up has been created to capitalize on the idea. In February, [Maze Therapeutics][6] announced [a $191 million series A funding round][2]. Based in South San Francisco, the company is led by Charles Homcy along with scientific team including:

 * Mark Daly, geneticist at the Broad, leader of Finland’s Finngen project.
 * Sekar Kathiresan, advocate for [clinical use of polygenic risk scores][5].
 * Stephen Elledge, geneticist and biochemist at Harvard Medical School.
 * Aaron Gitler, professor of genetics at Stanford University.
 * [Jonathan Weissman][8], professor at UCSF.
 * Matt Brauer, former bioinformaticist at Genentech.

The hope is that modifier genes may hold [the secret to new drugs][7].

Maze is working with public(-ish) datasets. The Nature Biotech article, [Unicorn startup trawls databases for protective genetic modifiers][4], included this handy table of large genetics data sets:
