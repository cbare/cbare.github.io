In the northwest corner of the [Olympic National Park][2], there's a gem of a hike called the [High Divide - Seven Lakes Basin Loop][1], 19 miles with views stretching from the glaciated peak of Mt. Olympus down into the depths of the Hoh river valley.

Back in 2016, I did the loop as a 3 day backpacking trip. Enough day-hikers blew past me on the trail that I was inspired to want to try to do the loop in a single day. This was the year that Jen helped me make it happen.

I got on the trail at the leasurely hour of 9am and was back at my car at 6pm. It's definitely possible to do it faster. I chatted with a couple wearing trail-running jerseys and an Ironman cap on the way up. Once the trail opened up, I saw them in the distance way up ahead then didn't see them again. No doubt, they were showered and halfway through dinner by the time I got off the trail.

Logistical notes:

 * You can get a fat breakfast bright and early at the [Sol Duc Hot Springs Resort][3] about 15 minutes from the trailhead.

 * I started with 4 liters of liquids, which is heavy. If you have a filter, there's plenty of running water between the trailhead and Deer Lake, and from Heart Lake onward. Don't run dry up on the ridge, or you'll have to drop down into 7-lakes basin.
