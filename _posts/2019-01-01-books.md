Happy new year! What's happy about it, you ask? ...well, there's always books.

Digging through some old journals, I came across a bunch of notes and lists of books I read in past years. I remember having a conversation with my then-50-ish Dad in which he couldn't remember whether or not he'd read some book I was excited about. I was astonished that he could possibly have read an entire book and completely forgotten it. Now, 50-ish myself, I get it.

So on that note, here are as many books as I can dig out of these notes and my collapsing memory:
