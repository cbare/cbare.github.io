During my undergraduate days, I joked that I was in the major of the month club. Computer science was always there, but I took a bunch of Biology, Econ., and a bit of English Lit. Back then, I thought that learning should be purely driven by curiousity.

These days, the curious person is in luck. The academics of the world have produced an endless supply of on-line classes, lectures, papers, talks, and books; enough to fill several life-times with study on any topic.

Back in 2011, Andrew Ng's Machine Learning class started a wave of online classes. I took that one and a bunch more since.
