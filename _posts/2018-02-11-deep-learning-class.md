Back in 2011, when Andrew Ng released a free class in Machine Learning, I was one of about 13,000 students who finished. In the ensuing wave of excitement over online courses, Coursera and EdX got started.

Since then, I've done a bunch of MOOCs, on machine learning, statistics, and programming languages. I'm pretty happy with the approach in that it fits structured learning into an otherwise full schedule.

This past week, I started another Andrew Ng class, this time in [deep learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning). The first homework is to train a model to recogize cat pictures, like this one:
