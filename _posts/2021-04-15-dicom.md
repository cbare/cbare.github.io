DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) is a file format for medical imaging that combines pixels and clinical data in one file.

For the basics, see LifeWire's [What Is a DICOM File?][13]

## Reference

The National Electrical Manufacturers Association maintains the primary [reference for the DICOM format][1].

Two important bits are:

- [Table 6-1. Registry of DICOM Data Elements][2]
- [Table 6.2-1. DICOM Value Representations][3]


## Deidentification and anonymization

Because the DICOM format combines both image and data, they typically contain plenty of PII and PHI. For research purposes, deidentification and anonymization is the first step.

- [Table E.1-1. Application Level Confidentiality Profile Attributes][5].
- [DICOM Anonymization][6] by Marina Chane
- Duke Medicine's Office of Information Security put out some [Guidance on Deidentification/Anonymization of DICOM images for use in a Research Setting][7]
- [De-identification Revisited][10] slides from David Clunie
- [Is there an easy way to find the type of a DICOM tag?][8]
- [Protecting Protected Health Information from DICOM images][9]
- Apparently Google has something called the [Cloud Healthcare API][12] which will help you [De-identifying DICOM data][11].


## More

- [DICOM Library][4] is an image sharing service for education and research.
- [Pydicom][14] is a pure Python package for working with DICOM files such as medical images, reports, and radiotherapy objects.
