Interesting stuff, early 2020. Still working on my [previous on-deck list](/2019-11-13/on-deck.html).


## Machine Learning

 * [Python Machine Learning 3rd ed.](https://www.packtpub.com/data/python-machine-learning-third-edition)
 * [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2)
 * [Unsupervised Evaluation and Weighted Aggregation of Ranked Classification Predictions](http://jmlr.org/papers/v20/18-094.html) by Mehmet Eren Ahsen, Robert M Vogel, Gustavo A Stolovitzky
 * [Building the Software 2.0 Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zywIvINSlaI) a 2018 talk by Andrej Karpathy. Interesting thinking, although I don't love the way it divides software engineering from ML. The talk is better than the origin blog post [Software 2.0](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35).
 * [Neurips 2019 videos](https://slideslive.com/neurips#!feed=popular), [Notes by David Abel](https://david-abel.github.io/notes/neurips_2019.pdf)
 * [On the Measure of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547) Francois Chollet

### NLP

 * Neural Network Methods for NLP, by Yoav Goldberg
 * [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/), Jurafsky & Martin
 * [Stanford CS224N: NLP with Deep Learning, Winter 2019](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)
 * Christopher Potts made some [hort screencasts on core concepts in natural language understanding](https://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/talks.html)
 * Christopher Olah on [Understanding LSTM Networks](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) (2015)

#### AI and NLP in Healthcare

 * Andrew Maas speaking on [ML/NLP for Healthcare Analytics](https://roamanalytics.com/2018/12/04/andrew-maas-in-stanfords-seminar-in-artificial-intelligence-in-healthcare/) (Dec, 2018). Andrew is cofounder and chief scientist at Roam Analytics, a machine learning platform for healthcare. Andrew graduated with a PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2015, advised by Andrew Ng and Dan Jurafsky.
