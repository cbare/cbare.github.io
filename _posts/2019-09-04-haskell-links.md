New York Block chain bros think it's hip. It's an abstruse language used by few and understood by fewer... It's Haskell!

Fresh from [functional programming summer school][13], which was super-fun, I'm jazzed up about Haskell. So, if you are too, here's a pile of links bigger than the average wiener-roast.

## Learning Haskell
 * [Basics of Haskell][1], written by Bartosz Milewski in 2013 at School of Haskell
 * UPenn CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell in 2 versions from [spring 2013](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/) and [fall 2016](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/)
 * [Haskell Programming from First Principles][7]
 * The [Data61 (formerly NICTA) FP course][11]
 * [Learn you a Haskell][12]

## Intermediate
 * [The Haskell Phrasebook][2]
 * [What we talk about when we talk about monads][6] by Tomas Petricek
 * [Lexi King's Opinionated guide to Haskell in 2018](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2018/02/10/an-opinionated-guide-to-haskell-in-2018/)
 * Chris Allen's [How to learn Haskell](https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell) and [Functional Education](https://bitemyapp.com/blog/functional-education/)
 * [Functors, Applicatives, And Monads In Pictures](http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html)
 * [Lenses In Pictures](http://adit.io/posts/2013-07-22-lenses-in-pictures.html)
 * [Your easy guide to Monads, Applicatives, & Functors](https://medium.com/@lettier/your-easy-guide-to-monads-applicatives-functors-862048d61610)

## Papers
 * John Hughs paper [Why Functional Programming Matters][6] with talks available on YouTube.
 * Monads for Functional Programming, Philip Wadler
 * Theorems for free, Philip Wadler
 * Applicative programming with effects, McBride and Paterson
 * Monoids: Theme and Variations, Brent Yorgey

## ML/NLP in Haskell
 * [Neural Networks, Types, and Functional Programming][8] by Christopher Olah
 * [Backprop as Functor][10] A compositional perspective on supervised
learning
 * [DataHaskell](https://www.datahaskell.org)
 * Natural Language Processing for the Working Programmer, DaniÃ«l de Kok and Harm Brouwer


## Mathematical background

After years of graduate school you may eventually understand functors, applicatives and monads. Trust us. It's worth it.

### Algebra
 * [Abstract Algebra videos][3], by Socratica
 * [Basic Algebraic Structures][4]
 * [Milne, Algebra Course Notes][5]

### Category theory
 * [Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory][24]
 * [Category Theory for Programmers][27], Bartosz Milewski
 * [The Catsters][29]
 * [Category Theory: Lecture Notes and Online Books][28]
 * Category Theory in Context, [Emily Riehl](http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/)
